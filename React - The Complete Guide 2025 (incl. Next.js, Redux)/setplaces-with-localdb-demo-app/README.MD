# React Set Places with Local Database Demo Application

A **Place Picker** application that allows users to select places from a list of destinations they would like to visit, add them to a personalized list, and remove any in case they change their mind.  
It can load available places, add and store them locally, reload to refetch stored places, update them when needed, and delete or remove entries as desired.
