# React Router Events Spa App Demo

A demo React application with a minimal Node.js backend for simplified JWT-based authentication using Express and Node.js.
It allows users to register, log in, log out, and navigate through different routes using React Router DOM.
The app also provides the ability to create, edit, or modify an event from an existing path navigation leading to the already created list of events.
It includes multiple error-handling scenarios and validations, that cover most major SPA requirements for basic authentication and routing.

## Getting Started

### 1. Install all project dependencies

# In the backend application (from the main folder)
cd backend
npm install

# In the frontend application(from the main folder)
cd frontend
npm install

### 2. Start the application (in two separate terminals)

# Start the backend server
cd backend
node app.js

# Start the front-end app
cd frontend
npm start

### 3. Access the project
Once both servers are running, open your browser at:
http://localhost:3000
