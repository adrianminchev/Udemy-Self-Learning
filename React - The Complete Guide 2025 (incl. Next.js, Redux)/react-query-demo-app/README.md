# React Query Events Demo App

A demo React application using React Router DOM and TanStack/React Query, with a minimal Node.js backend using Express.js. The application allows users to add new events (with multiple input fields) to an event list, search existing events, edit/modify them, and delete/remove them. It includes multiple error-handling scenarios, validation, and navigation using routing.

## Getting Started

### 1. Install all project dependencies

# In the backend application (from the main folder)
cd backend
npm install

# In the main application folder
npm install

### 2. Start the application (in two separate terminals)

# Start the backend server
cd backend
npm start

# Start the front-end app (main app folder)
npm run dev

### 3. Access the project
Once both servers are running, open your browser at:
http://localhost:5173
